                Global Warming, the phenomenon of increasing average air temperature near the surface of Earthover the past one to two centuries. Climate scientists have since the mid-20th century gathered detailed observations of various weatherphenomena (such as temperatures, precipitation, and storms) and of related influences on climate (such as ocean currentsand the atmosphere’s chemical composition). These data indicate that Earth’s climate has changed over almost every conceivable timescale since the beginning of geologic time and that the influence of humanactivities since at least the beginning of the Industrail Revolution has been deeply woven into the very fabric ofclimate change.
A special report produced by the IPCC in 2018 honed this estimate further, noting that human beings and human activities have been responsible for a worldwide average temperature increase of between 0.8 and 1.2 °C (1.4 and 2.2 °F) of global warming since preindustrial times, and most of the warming observed over the second half of the 20th century could be attributed to human activities. It predicted that the global mean surface temperature would increase between 3 and 4 °C (5.4 and 7.2 °F) by 2100 relative to the 1986–2005 average should carbon emissions continue at their current rate. The predicted rise in temperature was based on a range of possible scenarios that accounted for future greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation (severity reduction) measures and on uncertainties in the model projections. Some of the main uncertainties include the precise role of feedback processes and the impacts of industrial pollutants known as aerosols, which may offset some warming.
The average surface temperature of Earth is maintained by a balance of various forms of solar and terrestrial radiation. Solar radiation is often called “shortwave” radiation because the frequencies of the radiation are relatively high and the wavelengths relatively short—close to the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Terrestrial radiation, on the other hand, is often called “longwave” radiation because the frequencies are relatively low and the wavelengths relatively long—somewhere in the infrared part of the spectrum. Downward-moving solar energy is typically measured in watts per square metre. The energy of the total incoming solar radiation at the top of Earth’s atmosphere (the so-called “solar constant”) amounts roughly to 1,366 watts per square metre annually. Adjusting for the fact that only one-half of the planet’s surface receives solar radiation at any given time, the average surface insolation is 342 watts per square metre annually.
It is essential to distinguish the “natural,” or background, greenhouse effect from the “enhanced” greenhouse effect associated with human activity. The natural greenhouse effect is associated with surface warming properties of natural constituents of Earth’s atmosphere, especially water vapour, carbon dioxide, and methane. The existence of this effect is accepted by all scientists. Indeed, in its absence, Earth’s average temperature would be approximately 33 °C (59 °F) colder than today, and Earth would be a frozen and likely uninhabitable planet. What has been subject to controversy is the so-called enhanced greenhouse effect, which is associated with increased concentrations of greenhouse gases caused by human activity. In particular, the burning of fossil fuels raises the concentrations of the major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and these higher concentrations have the potential to warm the atmosphere by several degrees. </p>

There are a number of ways in which changes in land use can influence climate. The most direct influence is through the alteration of Earth’s albedo, or surface reflectance. For example, the replacement of forest by cropland and pasture in the middle latitudes over the past several centuries has led to an increase in albedo, which in turn has led to greater reflection of incoming solar radiation in those regions. This replacement of forest by agriculture has been associated with a change in global average radiative forcing of approximately –0.2 watt per square metre since 1750. In Europe and other major agricultural regions, such land-use conversion began more than 1,000 years ago and has proceeded nearly to completion. For Europe, the negative radiative forcing due to land-use change has probably been substantial, perhaps approaching –5 watts per square metre. The influence of early land use on radiative forcing may help to explain a long period of cooling in Europe that followed a period of relatively mild conditions roughly 1,000 years ago. It is generally believed that the mild temperatures of this “medieval warm period,” which was followed by a long period of cooling, rivaled those of 20th-century Europe.
Land-use changes can also influence climate through their influence on the exchange of heat between Earth’s surface and the atmosphere. For example, vegetation helps to facilitate the evaporation of water into the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. In this process, plants take up liquid water from the soil through their root systems. Eventually this water is released through transpiration into the atmosphere, as water vapour through the stomata in leaves. While deforestation generally leads to surface cooling due to the albedo factor discussed above, the land surface may also be warmed as a result of the release of latent heat by the evapotranspiration process. The relative importance of these two factors, one exerting a cooling effect and the other a warming effect, varies by both season and region. While the albedo effect is likely to dominate in middle latitudes, especially during the period from autumn through spring, the evapotranspiration effect may dominate during the summer in the midlatitudes and year-round in the tropics. The latter case is particularly important in assessing the potential impacts of continued tropical deforestation. The rate at which tropical regions are deforested is also relevant to the process of carbon sequestration (see Carbon cycle feedbacks), the long-term storage of carbon in underground cavities and biomass rather than in the atmosphere. By removing carbon from the atmosphere, carbon sequestration acts to mitigate global warming. Deforestation contributes to global warming, as fewer plants are available to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In addition, as fallen trees, shrubs, and other plants are burned or allowed to slowly decompose, they release as carbon dioxide the carbon they stored during their lifetimes. Furthermore, any land-use change that influences the amount, distribution, or type of vegetation in a region can affect the concentrations of biogenic aerosols, though the impact of such changes on climate is indirect and relatively minor.</p>

In order to reconstruct climate changes that occurred prior to about the mid-19th century, it is necessary to use “proxy” measurements—that is, records of other natural phenomena that indirectly measure various climate conditions. Some proxies, such as most sediment cores and pollen records, glacial moraine evidence, and geothermal borehole temperature profiles, are coarsely resolved or dated and thus are only useful for describing climate changes on long timescales. Other proxies, such as growth rings from trees or oxygen isotopes from corals and ice cores, can provide a record of yearly or even seasonal climate changes.
The data from these proxies should be calibrated to known physical principles or related statistically to the records collected by modern instruments, such as satellites. Networks of proxy data can then be used to infer patterns of change in climate variables, such as the behaviour of surface temperature over time and geography. Yearly reconstructions of climate variables are possible over the past 1,000 to 2,000 years using annually dated proxy records, but reconstructions farther back in time are generally based on more coarsely resolved evidence such as ocean sediments and pollen records. For these, records of conditions can be reconstructed only on timescales of hundreds or thousands of years. In addition, since relatively few long-term proxy records are available for the Southern Hemisphere, most reconstructions focus on the Northern Hemisphere.
The various proxy-based reconstructions of the average surface temperature of the Northern Hemisphere differ in their details. These differences are the result of uncertainties implicit in the proxy data themselves and also of differences in the statistical methods used to relate the proxy data to surface temperature. Nevertheless, all studies as reviewed in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), which was published in 2007, indicate that the average surface temperature since about 1950 is higher than at any time during the previous 1,000 years.
